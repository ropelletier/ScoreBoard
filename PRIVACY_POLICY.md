# Privacy Policy
###### version 1.0 of This Agreement was created on June 11, 2021.

ScoreBoard is an application for counting goals and a timer in sports games and outputting results to third-party streamer programs (OBS, WireCast, etc.).

## What information do we collect?

ScoreBoard does not collect information. 
For the ScoreBoard to work properly, it prompts the user for access to a user-selected directory to save the results.

We do not use or have access to your personal data, including all data related to your files, contacts, programs and library on your device.
