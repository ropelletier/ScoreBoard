# ScoreBoard (.txt) for MacOS
**Scoreboard for online broadcasting of sports games (hockey, football and others) through OBS.**

## Downloads
[Release v1.4](https://github.com/kopsap4ik/ScoreBoard/releases/tag/1.4)

## Info
The program counts the time (timer and countdown), keeps the goals and period (half), and also shows the team names.

All output data are stored in TXT files on the computer. Each of them can be used in OBS (add source: text) over a picture of any scoreboard.

In the settings window (gear icon), you can select the desired directory to save TXT files.

## Important information
Since the program is not signed with an Apple certificate, it is necessary to manually enable launch at startup:
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Go to Security & Privacy and select the General tab.
3. If you've been blocked from opening an app within the past hour, this page will give you the option to override this by clicking the temporary button 'Open Anyway'.
4. You'll be asked one more time if you're sure, but clicking Open will run the app.
